# UniCat — a platform where university students connect

UniCat is a Django-based web platform to connect university students across Catalonia.  
It provides a place to **share academic resources**, **discover/post university events**, and **connect Erasmus students** going to the same universities.  
The backend is built with **Django + Django REST Framework**, and the frontend uses templates with Bootstrap and JavaScript for a responsive UI.
